# AI-Agent-Health-Symptom-Checker_08
 An Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker helps users understand their health conditions 
by analyzing symptoms and providing probable causes, preventive advice, and care recommendations. 
It retrieves verified medical data, symptom databases, and guidelines from trusted sources like WHO, 
government health portals, and medical journals. 
Users can input symptoms in natural language such as “I have a sore throat and fever,” and the agent 
provides possible conditions, urgency level, home remedies, and when to consult a doctor.
